# Metrics & Dimensions Definitions

## Key Metrics

### Total Sales
- **Definition:** The aggregate revenue generated from all completed sales transactions within the selected time period.
- **Why This Metric Exists:** Total Sales is the primary indicator of business scale and market demand. It answers the most fundamental question: *How much revenue is the business generating?*
- **Purpose It Serves:** Establishes a baseline for all other performance metrics such as profit, margin, and customer value.
- **Analytical Insight:** Enables comparison across regions, products, and industries to identify revenue drivers and concentration risks.
- **Value:** $2.30M

### Total Profit
- **Definition:** The net financial gain after subtracting all associated costs from total sales.
- **Why This Metric Exists:** Revenue alone does not indicate business health. Profit highlights whether sales activities are financially sustainable.
- **Purpose It Serves:** Helps stakeholders evaluate cost efficiency, pricing effectiveness, and overall financial performance.
- **Analytical Insight:** When analyzed alongside Total Sales, it reveals high-revenue but low-margin products or regions.
- **Value:** $286.40K

### Total Orders

### Average Order Value (AOV)

### Profit Margin
- **Formula:** (Total Profit ÷ Total Sales) × 100
