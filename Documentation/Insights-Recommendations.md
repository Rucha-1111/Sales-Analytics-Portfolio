# Business Insights & Recommendations

## Key Findings

### Revenue Concentration Risk
A small subset of products drives most revenue and profit, creating portfolio dependency risk.

### High Sales ≠ High Profit
Several products generate strong sales but weak profit due to discounting or cost structure issues.

### Regional Revenue Imbalance
Despite equal customer distribution, EMEA generates significantly higher revenue per customer than APJ.

### Discount Strategy Weakness
Inconsistent discounting practices risk long-term margin erosion.

### Industry Specialization Success
Finance sector dominance validates vertical-specific product strategy.
